# Problem logs

doing DSA in cpp with lc/cf problems, logging my reasoning along the way 

little ai use here, except feeding it stack traces or syntax questions, all the reasoning must be from me, this is mostly about reaching the optimal solution through my own thought processes, and if that isnt enough, to change my thought processes

main goals:

 - building more code muscle memory
 - thinking more algorithmically
